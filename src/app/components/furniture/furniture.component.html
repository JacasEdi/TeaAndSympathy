    <p>
      We source pieces from auction houses and antique markets, locally if possible, and love to find quirky and
      interesting pieces. Our love of all things antique, well made and authentic, helps us create individual pieces
      with a rustic or distressed look, built up through layers of painting and waxing, all in natural materials from
      the Annie Sloane range. We’re always finishing off new pieces so pop into the shop to see what we have.

  <mat-tab label="Commission us">
    <div>
      <p>You can either commission us to ‘Tea & Sympathy’ one of your existing pieces of furniture or we can source a
        piece for you. It might be you want to revamp for an old chest you've had in the loft for years or to bring your
        grandma’s table back to life. Or perhaps you have your heart set on a new dressing table – you can simply tell
        us
        what you would like and we can source something for you from the auction houses and antique markets that we use.
        Either way, we can chat about what sort of colours and finish you would like, to ensure it will sit perfectly in
        your home. Just drop us an email or give us a call and we can get started.</p>
